This web application is for showing and sorting movie api from TMDB.
You can get your own api from https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started

It was made by ReactJS.

What I learned from making project,
1. Component life cycle
2. Class component and state
3. Axios and using awaite
4. react-router-dom

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
